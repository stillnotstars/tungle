# an accessible tumblr theme

hi! this is a tumblr theme i made. graphic design is not my passion, but it does have the following features:

- screenreader accessible
- screenreaders can scroll through posts by using headings!!
- keyboard accessible
- can zoom to however big you like
- has a blacklist function---you do have to hit the blacklist button every time you move to a different page though
- image alt text shows up when you hover over the image, if it exists

you can go to [laufeyj-arson dot tumblr dot com](https://laufeyj-arson.tumblr.com) for a demo.

i don't use tumblr anymore, and also i wrote most of this code years ago when i didn't actually understand how javascript works, so things might be broken. if something comes up, [open an issue in this repo](https://github.com/stillnotstars/tungle/issues/new) or ping me on mastodon [@daffodilian@weirder.earth](https://weirder.earth/@daffodilian).

## how to install
click this link and and copy the text in it: [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stillnotstars/tungle/main/theme.html)

open the tumblr customizer. at the top of the sidebar, under your current theme name, should be the text "edit html." click that, delete everything currently there, and paste the plain text from the previously linked file. click "update preview," "save," and tweak settings as needed.

unfortunately you have to manually repeat this step every time i update the code here.

## possible improvements?

- [ ] more robust blacklisting??

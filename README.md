# an accessible tumblr theme

hi! this is a tumblr theme i made. graphic design is not my passion, but it does have the following features:

- screenreader accessible
- screenreaders can scroll through posts by using headings!!
- keyboard accessible
- can zoom to however big you like
- has a filtering function to hide posts via the list of tags in the sidebar. you do have to hit the block button every time you move to a different page, though.
- image alt text shows up when you hover over the image, if it exists

you can go to [whale-blanket dot tumblr dot com](https://whale-blanket.tumblr.com) for a demo.

this theme isn't thoroughly tested. if you find an issue with it, [open an issue in this repo](https://github.com/stillnotstars/tungle/issues/new), ping me on mastodon [@daffodilian@weirder.earth](https://weirder.earth/@daffodilian), or send an ask to my tumblr: [@whale-blanket](https://whale-blanket.tumblr.com).

shoutouts to [1linelayouts](https://1linelayouts.glitch.me/) for being a cool css resource for a bunch of fancy stuff with `display: grid/flex`.

## how to install
make sure you can use custom themes-- go to your blog settings and toggle "enable custom theme" to on.

copy the text in [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stillnotstars/tungle/main/theme.html).

open the theme customizer. at the top of the sidebar, under your current theme name, should be the text "edit html." click that, delete everything currently there, and paste the plain text from the previously linked file. click "update preview," "save," and tweak settings as needed.

unfortunately you have to manually repeat this step every time i update the code here.

## possible improvements?

- [ ] make embedded youtube videos, photosets, etc display properly - tumblr makes it real fuckin difficult to control stuff like this and i don't know if it's possible
- [ ] more fonts? idk i don't actually care much about aesthetics. i've just listed the system defaults lol
- [ ] filtering persistently over multiple pages (absolutely no idea how to do this)
- [ ] matching filters on words rather than a specific tag?
